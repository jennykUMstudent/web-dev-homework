# Assignment 2
## Jenny Keller
I decided to take creative coding to get gain an understanding of how to build a website. I think it's a useful skill when going into media arts as a career path. Being able to work on websites for companies, or develop my own website as my portfolio. This is my second time taking this class, so this time I hope to gain a better understanding of CSS and do a more precise job in the first two module topics.
I have learned 1) the internet vs the web, and how they work; 2) what a VCS is; and 3) what a cookie is
